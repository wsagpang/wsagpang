- 👋 Hi, I’m Whimcy Sagpang. My pronouns are she/her and I am a development worker.
- 📍 I am from Davao, Philippines.
- 🏢 I'm currently working for ACDI/VOCA under PhilCAFE Project ☕ as MIS Coordinator. My previous work background is on Monitoring and Evaluation and although as MIS in A/V, I am under the M&E team, my work now is focused on database management, mobile data collection tool creation, and dashboard maintenance.
- 🌱 I consider myself as a newbie in R since it is just a few years ago that I started using R again
